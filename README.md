# My - My touchbar. My rules. - Rules.

My configuration for the extremely useful [MTMR](https://github.com/Toxblh/MTMR/).

I really only used my touchbar for Touch ID and a few rare cases, but MTMR has made it far more useful.

## Installation

Bluetooth button requires `blueutil`, which can be installed with `brew install blueutil`.

VPN check is done using the `mtmr_vpncheck` script. You can either place the script in your `$PATH` or change the config to point to their absolute path. VPN checks will vary between VPN providers. Check the utun[0-9] interface that is active when your VPN is connected.

Update the weather config to use your own API key and update the city in `actionAppleScript`.

For Do Not Disturb to work, you must set the keyboard shortcut to `Shift-Ctrl-Opt-Cmd-D` or change the shortcut in `items.json`.

## Weather

The weather from wttr.in is for made for consoles, but it's simple to grab an image of and display, which is why I picked it.
